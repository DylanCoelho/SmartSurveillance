# SmartSurveillance
This is IOT mini project of sem 5. (June-2020)
This model will capture the direction of the intruder and it will display distance and angle of the intruder on Blynk app. 
This system uses ultrasonic sensors to measure speed and uses a micro servo motor to move the ultrasonic sensor 180 degree.
The PIR sensor is used to detect the presence of an intruder manually to overcome reseach gaps we found. 
NodeMCU and blynk app is used to notify authorized people about intruder activity.
